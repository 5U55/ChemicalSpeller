# Chemical Speller
Javascript project that spells out words using element symbols. There are options to spell the words as short as possible and only using element symbols as well as to show the atomic weight and color code of the elements. 

I originally created this project on glitch.com and it can be found at https://chemical.glitch.me/ or https://glitch.com/~chemical
